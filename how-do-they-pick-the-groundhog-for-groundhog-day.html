When German immigrants settled Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries, they brought the custom with them, <b>choosing the native groundhog as the annual forecaster</b>.</span></span><h2>How is the groundhog chosen?</h2>On Groundhog Day, a bunch of men, wearing suits and top hats, pull a groundhog out of a hole in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. They then read a scroll the groundhog supposedly wrote, that states whether or not it saw its shadow. This determines if winter will last another six weeks, or if spring is coming soon.<h2>Do they use the same groundhog on Groundhog Day?</h2>They say he is basically immortal.<p>It's been the same Punxsutawney Phil for all 132 years of the tradition, according to the club. That's over 15 times longer than the upper end of a groundhog's typical lifespan. That's an old groundhog.</p><h2>How does the groundhog prediction work?</h2>According to folklore, if a groundhog emerges from its hole and sees its shadow, it gets scared and scurries back into its burrow, predicting six more weeks of winter. If the groundhog does not see its shadow, the prediction is that there will be an early spring.<h2>How many Punxsutawney Phil's have there been?</h2>How many "Phils" have there been over the years?

Lee holds a 63% accuracy rating nationally, with a 70-80% accuracy rating for certain regions of the United States.<h2>How often is Punxsutawney Phil correct?</h2>NOAA compared Phil's predictions from the last 10 years to the actual weather from that year and found that Phil was only right 40% of the time. The last year Phil's prediction was right was in 2020, when he predicted an early spring. However, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club insists Phil has never been wrong.<h2>How Old Is Phil the groundhog?</h2>HOW OLD IS PHIL? According to Groundhog Club members, there has only been one Phil — and he has been predicting since 1887. That makes him 135 years old!<h2>Who is the original groundhog?</h2>In 1887, a newspaper editor belonging to a group of groundhog hunters from Punxsutawney called the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club declared that Phil, the Punxsutawney groundhog, was America's only true weather-forecasting groundhog.<h2>When was the last time groundhog didn't see shadow?</h2>In 2019, the 133rd year of the tradition, the groundhog was summoned to come out at 7:25 am on February 2, but did not see its shadow.<h2>What is the lifespan of a groundhog?</h2>Wild groundhogs, also known as woodchucks, one average live four to five years, but can live up to six years. In captivity they can live ten or more years.<h2>What happened to Punxsutawney Phil?</h2>How about a Wabbit? CORRECTION: Punxsutawney Phil is alive and well! The groundhog that died was the New Jersey version, known as Milltown Mel. No one knows when he slumbered off, but it was during his hibernation phase.<h2>What immigrant group brought the Groundhog Day tradition to the US?</h2>Groundhog Day brings forth a unique wintertime tradition, but the roots of this strange celebration can actually be traced back to German settlers. As many of you know, many of the early settlers from Germany built their communities in Pennsylvania, bringing their own traditions with them to the New World.<h2>Did Phil see his shadow 2021?</h2>Punxsutawney Phil emerged to some falling snow on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2021, and saw his shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter.<h2>Did Milltown Mel see his shadow?</h2>Last year, Milltown Mel did not see his shadow, and predicted an early spring.
