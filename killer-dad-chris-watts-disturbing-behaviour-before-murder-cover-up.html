By the time the 33-year-old joined his family in North Carolina after five weeks, he was cold and distant.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p>The pair fought and Shanann confided in friends that Watts would not touch or hold her.

The doubtful group of friends looked up the price of that meal at the restaurant in question — it was a third of what he had paid.</p><p>He was out with his mistress, while a babysitter cared for the children.</p><p>The following night, Nichol spoke to Watts between 9pm and 11pm, and was surprised to hear he was watching television — "odd behaviour for him" because of his 6am start at work. They regularly spoke while he stayed in the basement of the family home, but she recalled wondering if he was waiting up for his wife.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/SNMx33obKfXO8e1-cLK39in6kkc=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/VAEUF7XKBJJBACBSTCMKB7FXKY.jpg"><p>Shanann was dropped off at home by her friend Nickole Atkinson just before 2am on Monday, August 13, and it's at this point that there's a gap in the timeline.</p><p>Footage from 5.30am shows Watts backing his work truck up to the garage before driving off, something the family's friends agreed was unusual.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Jf1ImHCCdcHTmv3JkJcpy2ZfhtQ=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/XLRLC57MUSG4IGZ53LYZVW2OS4.jpg"><p>Police believe that at some point during this window he viciously killed his wife and children, before driving the bodies to the site of the oil and gas company where he worked.</p><h2 class=article__heading>'HE DID NOT SEEM OVERLY CONCERNED'</h2><p>A fellow Anadarko Petroleum employee said she saw Watts digging a hole near an oil drum at the work site.</p><p>Nickole, the colleague who had dropped Shanann at home from the airport, knew her pregnant friend had been feeling ill and was concerned when she failed to answer messages and missed a doctor's appointment.</p><p>Nicki went to the house, and when she found it empty, she called Watts.
