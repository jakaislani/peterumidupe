But the St. Louis–raised Kloss remains a Midwestern girl who was brought up right. She’s three years into Kode with Klossy, her 10-city (and growing) program to inspire young girls to learn coding and enter the tech world, and over a year into her feminist studies at NYU (complemented handily by today’s look: a Dior T-shirt that says “We Should All Be Feminists”).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But right now she’s just going to extend her illegally long legs under the table for a chat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Behind the Cover: Karlie Kloss</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LAURA BROWN: At the British <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fashion</a> Awards in London last December, you were posing away on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>red carpet</a> in a </b><b>sparkly Swarovski thing, and it was freezing. I just thought, “How does she keep turning up and doing that?”</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KARLIE KLOSS: </b>First of all, I’m a Leo, so when I need to turn it on, I do. I enjoy the adrenaline—not just when I’m walking the red carpet but also when I’m on set or in a runway show or even in the small film things I’ve done. I don’t know; I’m going to throw it to being a Leo because I have no other explanation! But I also know the feeling of being spent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What happens when you’re spent? </b>I book myself out. I take time. I shut off. I don’t post to social media for a couple of days, and I find that to be really rewarding and healthy. It actually reenergizes me to be able to turn it back on and have fun. We’re multitasking women; we all have a lot going on. But you also have to protect yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally and give yourself time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>“Book yourself out”: I know that’s a model term, but metaphorically, it’s a good idea too.</b>Yeah. Because you know what? It’s not a matter of being lazy—the returns are tenfold: You’ll be able to show up with more energy, more drive, more focus. It’ll pay off.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Giambattista Valli Haute Couture silk mousseline gown.

There’s a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>beauty</a> in knowing what you can’t do.</b>There’s also a beauty in not trying to figure it all out. Things like Kode with Klossy happened because after graduating from high school, I was fully focusing on my modeling career but at a certain point was uninspired. That’s why I started taking a coding class.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>When you sat down for that first coding class, did it feel like, “Oh, great!” or “Oh, s—!”? </b>I only got myself into that first coding class because I was genuinely curious about it and I met someone who started the Flatiron School … I am someone who if you tell me I have to do something, I’m less inclined to do it, but I took that class because I was really interested in how all this works. It’s how the world is actually built. Code is the secret language that builds all the digital architecture of everything that we rely on. And pretty much a fraction of people know about it, yet we all use it. I’ve always been intrigued by the direction nobody else is going in. Not following the herd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Karlie Kloss Expands Her Coding Summer Camp for Girls for 2017</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gaultier Paris embroidered tulle dress and leather corset.

I remember buying a pair of black high heels from Target in St. Louis because I had to practice learning how to walk in them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>OK, set the scene for me, please. </b>I had just turned 15—now 18 is the minimum age to model—and started high school on a Monday, and by Friday I was on a plane to New York for a casting call. I thought, “There’s no way anyone is going to book me for New York Fashion Week, but it’s good to go and see people.” I had my high heels from Target and a little black dress from Macy’s that my mom bought me. It became my lucky little black dress that I continued to wear again and again. That was the outfit I was wearing when I walked into Calvin Klein in 2008 and got cast in the show that launched my career. I look back at photos, and I’m like, “How and why did anybody book me?” I was a child! But I was a very tall child. I’ve always been kind of an old soul, I guess.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>You’ve always read older. I’m still surprised at how young </b><b>you are.</b>I really loved those years. And it was so different. The whole digital situation was different.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Do you think social media makes it harder or easier to suc</b><b>ceed? </b>I think it’s a different ball game. You have to have a strong presence on the runway, schlep around the world to build a book for editorial, work with the right people, and be in the right campaigns. You also have to have a digital presence and brand yourself. Maybe it’s easier to break through now because it’s democratized. It’s not like there are three important people in the fashion industry who are going to say, “Yes, you’re going to be successful.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>It’s the people’s choice. </b>Right, and that’s what’s really interesting. Something can become successful if it’s a good idea or if it’s going against the grain. It’s hard to predict.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>It’s important to have constants in all this, right?

I’ve always been super-close with my family. They are my rock. There’s so much uncertainty in every direction, like, “Are you gonna get this job?” So having a solid crew, whether it’s your family or a partner, that’s a big part of being able to function.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What does being a feminist mean to you?</b>Actually, I’m taking a feminism class at NYU right now. It’s about the political history of feminism, really, since the ’60s and ’70s. The term “feminism” means different things to different people; a lot of people throw it around without really understanding the weight of it because it is layered. Two women can identify as feminists and have wildly different ways of living their lives. I love what Maria Grazia [Chiuri] is doing at Dior. She’s such a powerhouse. Having women in leadership positions is so important. Hopefully it will happen in the White House someday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Would you ever consider making a run for the White House? </b>Never say never, right?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So, we did a superhero shoot to</b><b>gether for <i>InStyle.</i> Who’s your real-life superhero? </b>My mom, for sure. She battled really aggressive breast cancer when my three sisters and I were young. She survived by the skin of her teeth. I’ve grown up completely idolizing her. She’s so strong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Were you ever into superheroes?</b>Wonder Woman, of course!First of all, she’s got great style, hair, and accessories. And I love that she’s fearless. She doesn’t need a man. She’s so independent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Where would you go if you could fly an invisible jet? </b>I would love to be able to fly, period. Being invisible would be amazing. I’m 6'2", so it’s hard to be invisible, but at times I love just being a people-watcher, whether it’s in a café or the places I travel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Do you have days when you’re not recognized? </b>I put on a baseball hat and jeans and a T-shirt and nobody pays attention to me.

All my friends were, like, just getting their driver’s licenses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What do you spend your money on? </b>I am very ambitious as an entrepreneur and as a businesswoman, but it doesn’t matter how much money I make. I am frugal. I spend money on experiences. I like to take amazing vacations with my loved ones. I like property. I just bought a beautiful home in St. Louis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>That must be wonderful—coming back home with such success.</b>You know what’s crazy? I bought the house I used to babysit in. My only job before modeling was a $6-an-hour babysitting gig, which, by the way, was great. I feel like I have this Cinderella story, and I’m really grateful for it. It was not the path I was anticipating. Anyway, it’s come full circle for me.

Do you try to keep it to a certain time every day?</b>I like to work out in the morning and get it out of the way because it changes how I function the rest of the day. I feel more awake and am more aware of what I eat. Since I’m always traveling and in a different place, I started running. I love running in Paris and upstate New York. I also love strength training. If I work out, it doesn’t immediately change my body, but it changes my clarity, focus, and emotions. My job right now is reliant on my body, but that’s genuinely not why I work out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: This 101-Year-Old Woman Is the Only Fitness Inspiration You Need Today</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What’s your favorite thing to do?
