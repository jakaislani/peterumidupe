Despite never having taken an acting class, she dove headlong into show business in 1968 with her first television show, Mayberry R.F.D. From there, she continued on to a busy career as a child actor, with Brandy always by her side, playing the dual role of manager and mother. “I still treasure her impact. She was very strong, self-educated but wasn’t pushy. She’d stay in the trailer and read magazines while I worked,” Jodie later recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster’s first forays on the big screen came with roles in the Disney movies Napoleon and Samantha (1972) and One Little Indian (1973).

When asked about the differences between acting and directing, she said: “Well, you have control, but you also have 175 people involved. Acting, for me, is exhausting.

Although Orange Is the New Black was her first television directing gig, it earned her a 2014 Emmy nomination.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 title="More Recent Movies and True Detective" data-anchor-id=more-recent-movies-and-true-detective class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">More Recent Movies and True Detective</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Between her occasional directorial projects, Foster has continued to act in hit movies such as Nell (1994), Maverick (1994), Contact (1997), and the box-office smash Panic Room (2002). Nell, which she also helped produced, continued her string of award-worthy performances. She starred in the lead role as a young woman raised in complete isolation by her mother inside a cabin, alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/liam-neeson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Liam Neeson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Liam Neeson</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/natasha-richardson-death data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natasha Richardson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Natasha Richardson</a>. Foster was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar, though she didn’t win either.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster’s choice of scripts spans from blockbuster to indie and foreign. In The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002), she played a nun, Sister Assumpta, while also producing the film. She then took a small part in a French film The Very Long Engagement (2004).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster returned to big-budget Hollywood fare with 2005’s Flightplan and 2006’s Inside Man but has been very selective about her projects in recent years. She worked with director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/roman-polanski data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roman Polanski" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roman Polanski</a> on his dramatic comedy Carnage in 2011.

Creator and director Issa López says True Detective: Night Country is indirectly influenced by Silence of the Lambs and Foster’s Oscar-winning performance in it. “It’s impossible to do serial killers the same way after Hannibal [Lecter],” López <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/true-detective-night-country-silence-of-the-lambs-nods-chilling-new-season-8416223 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told EW" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told EW</a>. “The book is extraordinary, but it was the movie [that did that], and it was Jodie, so it was a no-brainer to go back there.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=46 title="Wife and Children " data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><img alt="jodie foster and alexandra hedison stand next to each other, smiling and hugging for a photo, they bothe wear dark jackets over blouses" title="Jodie Foster and Alexandra Hedison in April 2023" width=3904 height=5684 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jodie-foster-and-alexandra-hedison-attend-moca-gala-2023-at-news-photo-1703104962.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Jodie Foster has been married to her wife, Alexandra Hedison, since 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 2014, Foster married photographer and actor Alexandra Hedison in a private weekend ceremony. Hedison’s largest role has been in the TV series The L Word, though she also appeared in one episode each of Melrose Place and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman in the mid-1990s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster and Hedison, who was previously in a four-year relationship with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ellen-degeneres data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ellen DeGeneres" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ellen DeGeneres</a>, began dating in October 2013.

DeMille Award. She thanked her former partner Cydney Bernard, describing her as “one of the deepest loves of my life... my heroic co-parent, my ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life, my confessor, ski buddy, consigliere, most beloved BFF of 20 years.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster and Bernard met on the set of the 1993 film Sommersby. Their two sons—Charles, born in 1998, and Kit, born in 2001—were conceived by in vitro fertilization, but Foster hasn’t revealed the identity of their father. “I am so proud of our modern family,” Foster said in her 2013 acceptance speech. “Our amazing sons, Charlie and Kit, who are my reason to breathe and to evolve, my blood and soul.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Learn About Other Celebrity Families</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=53 title=Quotes data-anchor-id=quotes class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quotes</h2><ul data-node-id=54 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I don’t know why people think child actresses in particular are screwed up.
