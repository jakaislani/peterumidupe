In 2015, he told that he had no plans to settle down in his career.</p><p>"I will be stopping when I'm 104. I want to be able to enjoy my retirement," he said of hosting the controversial 'The Jerry Springer Show'. "I'm lucky. I don't need to make a living anymore. I work because it's enjoyable to do and people enjoy the show. As long as I'm healthy, I'll keep doing it.

Talking about the successful show's controversial nature, Springer previously said, "It's stupid. And it's got a niche, and no one else kind of goes in that niche, so I think that's one of the reasons it's lasted." "No one's watching because of me. They're watching because the stories are crazy and the people are outrageous," he added on the Today Show in 2017.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Springer died after a brief illness</h2><p>Jene Galvin, Springer's family spokesperson confirmed the TV presenter's cause of death as pancreatic cancer. The host's longtime friend and religious leader Rabbi Sandford Kopnick said Springer's "illness was sudden."</p><p>In a statement given to the outlet, Galvin recalled Springer's career and said that his "ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word."</p><p>"He's irreplaceable and his loss hurts immensely, but memories of his intellect, heart, and humor will live on. Funeral services and a memorial gathering are currently being developed. To remember Jerry, the family asks that in lieu of flowers, you consider following his spirit and make a donation or commit to an act of kindness to someone in need or a worthy advocacy organization. As he always said, 'Take care of yourself, and each other.'," the statement added.</p><h2 class=split>Springer's multi-faceted career</h2><p>Before he stepped into the TV industry, Springer was a politician who served on the City Council of Cincinnati in 1971 and was later elected as the city's mayor. He also had a career as an actor, lawyer, and judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Springer was also popular for the 'Judge Jerry' show which he produced and starred and the show ran for three seasons. Game show 'Baggage,' 'Springer on the Radio Show,' and the 'Jerry Springer Podcast' are among his other projects. In Cincinnati, the influential host also had a '60s folk music radio show.
