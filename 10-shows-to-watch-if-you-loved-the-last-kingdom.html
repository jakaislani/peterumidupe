Lord Benton, played by Alun Armstrong, aims to see that Harp does not succeed. The Globe and Mail’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Doyle</a> says the show is “an action-packed, uncomplicated and very entertaining yarn about the cutthroats who created [Canada] by plundering it, when they weren’t busy killing each other.
