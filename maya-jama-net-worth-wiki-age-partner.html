She decided to stop visiting her father in prison when she was 12 years old, and she did so for a decade.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, she stated that she had not noticed a problem. In 2017, while working on the documentary When Dads Kill, which dealt with young people’s experiences similar to her own, she relented and examined her relationship with her own father, who had been released from prison at the time, meeting with him in an attempt to elicit answers directly from him as to why he had ended up in prison.</p><p>In 2018, a tweet from Jama when she was 17 surfaced, detailing her laughter at a tweet mocking dark-skinned black women. She apologized after being accused of colorism, saying she was “an ignorant, stupid child” when she made the social media post in 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maya Jama age</h2><p>Maya is 28 years old as of 2022.

She also participated in the European JD Sports Christmas campaign.
