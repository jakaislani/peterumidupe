He also appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show (season 15).</p><p>In 2018, Michael recorded his own video named “Don’t judge me”, it is a representation of his teenage life. He published it on his Instagram on September 25th, saying: “As a teenager, I suffered so much from judging myself constantly when I would look in the mirror.</p><p>It has taken me years to overcome this feeling and I’m so grateful that I am finally beginning to feel comfortable in my own skin. The key to this is, of course, learning self-love but also surrounding yourself with people that love and believe in you more than you ever could. To those people, You know who are and I appreciate you all so much.”, choreography and idea by himself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-dameski-ellen></span><span>Michael Dameski Ellen</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-dameski-world-of-dance></span><span>Michael Dameski World of Dance</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“World of Dance” finalist Michael Dameski surprised host and mentor Jenna Dewan during the World Final by telling her that his final performance would be to a remix of “Survivor” by Destiny’s Child. It’s not necessarily what we would have expected from the young contemporary dancer who earlier that evening performed a sensitive number to Ed Sheeran.</p><p><strong>Dameski Michael doing his Moves.</strong></p><p>Dameski is nothing if not versatile, so after showing the judges his sensitive side he ended his night by going full-on “Mad Max.” Watch him above.</p><p>It has been hard for Dameski to be away from his home in Australia, so this song choice was meant to reflect his tenacity in pursuing his dance career in America after success Down Under (he won his country’s version of “So You Think You Can Dance” in 2014). Mission accomplished.</p><p>He started his performance by turning himself into a human game of pachinko, pulling himself in intricate movements up and down a pegboard. Then he dropped out of sight in a dramatic move before thrusting himself back up and performing battle-like moves with a staff downstage right in front of the judges.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-dameski-net-worth></span><span>Michael Dameski Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael estimated net worth and annual salary has not been released yet.
