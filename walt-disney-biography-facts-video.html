Born in 1901, Walter Elias “Walt” Disney grew to be one of America’s most preeminent business tycoons by the time he died in 1966. Within this short time, he also became a beloved animator, producer, director, screenwriter and voice actor. Not too bad for a cartoonist from Chicago. Although Walt Disney died almost 40 years ago, the mass media stronghold of his eponymous company remains as strong as ever. The voluminous canon of Walt Disney Studios, not to mention the work of all of its subsidiaries, often overshadows the life of its founder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Here are seven facts you may not have known about both the man and the studio he created.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mickey was almost named Mortimer</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On a train ride following a less than fruitful business meeting in 1928, Disney, then only 27 years old, sketched a mouse. This mouse would eventually become the official mascot of a multinational corporation worth tens of billions of dollars, but Walt, of course, didn’t know this at the time. He called the sketch “Mortimer Mouse” and showed it to his wife, Lily. After deeming the name Mortimer much too pompous, Lily suggested giving the mouse a cuter name, such as Mickey. Thankfully, Walt agreed with her, and a star was born.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Disney was anti facial hair with one exception</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It took almost 60 years, but, as of this year, employees at Walt Disney’s two U.S. theme parks can finally show up at work with a stylish beard or goatee (but only if they are “neat, polished, and professional,” according to the official memo). However, at Disneyland in the 50s and 60s, even guests with facial hair, not to mention longhaired hippies, were turned away, as they were told they unfortunately failed to meet the standards of Disneyland’s dress code. Even Jim McGuinn, the future frontman of The Byrds, was once denied admittance for sporting a provocative Beatle cut. The company eventually relented on this policy, though, and allowed all hirsute patrons to enjoy “The Happiest Place on Earth.” Now, the peculiar double standard: Think of any picture of Walt Disney that you have ever seen. What exists in almost all of them? A mustache.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The final words ever written by Disney were “Kurt Russell”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1966, as Disney was suffering from lung cancer and nearing the end of his life, he scrawled the name “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kurt-russell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kurt Russell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kurt Russell</a>” on a piece of paper and died soon after. At the time, Russell was a child actor for the studio and had just signed a lengthy contract. To this day, no one knows what Disney meant or intended, including Russell himself.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Disney still has a home at Disneyland</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the construction of Disneyland in the 1950s, Disney moved into a one-bedroom apartment above the theme park’s Fire Station on Main Street in order to work and watch his dream come to life. The apartment still exists and has been left largely untouched. During his stay there, Disney lit a lamp in the window to alert the staff of his presence. This lamp is now permanently ablaze in his honor.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Don’t be surprised if you experience Disney déjà vu</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When you first watched Disney’s Robin Hood, did you wonder if you had seen it all before? If so, there’s no need to worry. In 1915, an animation technique called rotoscoping was invented. This technique involves drawing over film footage of live actors, which allows animators to capture realistic human movement. It also lets animators recycle animated movements for use on characters in different films. So, the next time you watch Disney’s Robin Hood, just remember that large parts of it were, thanks to the studio’s use of rotoscoping, gathered from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Jungle Book, and The Aristocats.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mickey and Minnie Mouse actually got married</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wayne Allwine and Russi Taylor are not well-known names, even among Disney aficionados, but their animated personas are seared into most people’s minds. In 1991, Allwine, who was the voice of Mickey Mouse for 32 years, married Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse, and the couple remained happily married until Allwine’s death in 2009.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nobody, including Walt Disney, is perfect</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Disney was an innovative and successful man, he was also the subject of many controversies, most of which involved rumors that he was anti-Semitic and racist. These rumors were, and still are, hard to dispel. In the 1930s, Disney attended meetings of a pro-Nazi organization, the German American Bund. He also hosted a known Nazi propagandist and filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl, and gave her a tour of Disney Studios. To make matters worse, Disney was also accused of perpetuating black stereotypes in his films. But, for all of his critics, Disney also had scores of supporters who claimed he was far from being either anti-Semitic or racist. The debate on Disney’s alleged discrimination and racism continues to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVorpqkpGKxqr%2FNnrBmmpmktLOtz6GwZp6RmMG0edWim56n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html&text=7%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20the%20Man%20and%20the%20Magic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html&title=7%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20the%20Man%20and%20the%20Magic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html&title=7%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20the%20Man%20and%20the%20Magic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html&title=7%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20the%20Man%20and%20the%20Magic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalt-disney-biography-facts-video.html&description=7%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20the%20Man%20and%20the%20Magic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chrissy-metz-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chrissy Metz Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mo-rocca-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mo Rocca Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
