He embarked on his professional journey after be ing selected in the first round, securing the eighth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. But before making a name for himself in the NFL, Hockenson honed his skills on the college football field, donning the colors of the Iowa Hawkeyes.</p><p>Hockenson’s early life was rooted in Cherokee, Iowa, where he spent his formative years before later relocating to Chariton, Iowa. During his high school days at Chariton High School, he was a standout athlete, excelling not only in football but also in basketball. As a four-year letter winner in football, he left an indelible mark by setting school records for receiving yards in a game, season, and career.</p><p>His prowess on the field led his team to the state playoffs in his senior year, earning him the prestigious honor of being named to the all-state first team. His talents didn’t go unnoticed, as he was rated as a three-star recruit and ranked as the seventh-highest recruit in the state of Iowa for the class of 2016 by 247Sports.com Composite. He solidified his commitment to the Iowa Hawkeyes on June 20, 2015.</p><p>Hockenson’s college football journey began with a redshirt year in 2016. His sophomore year in 2017 saw him as one of the two starting tight ends for Iowa, alongside Noah Fant. In that season, he secured his first career receptions, showcasing his potential with two catches for 41 yards.</p><p>However, his breakout moment came during Iowa’s victory over then-No. 3 Ohio State, where he led the team with five receptions for 71 yards and two touchdowns. Throughout the year, he amassed 24 receptions for 320 yards and three receiving touchdowns.</p><p>The following year, in 2018, Hockenson’s star continued to rise.

He quickly made an impact in his rookie season, setting records for a tight end in his debut game with six receptions for 131 receiving yards and a touchdown, earning his place in NFL history. His rookie season saw him finish with 32 receptions for 367 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>In 2020, Hockenson continued to make strides in his career, scoring his first receiving touchdown of the season and making crucial catches, including a game-winning touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons. His performances earned him a Pro Bowl nod.</p><p>Hockenson remained a key figure for the Lions in the 2021 season, displaying consistency as the starting tight end, though he was sidelined due to a thumb injury later in the season. Despite the setback, he managed to accumulate 61 catches for 583 yards and four touchdowns through 12 games.</p><p>In 2022, the Lions exercised their option to retain Hockenson for another year. During a game against the Seattle Seahawks, he broke a long-standing Lions record by amassing 179 receiving yards in a single game, solidifying his reputation as a top-tier tight end.</p><p>Hockenson’s journey took a new turn on November 1, 2022, when he was traded to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for draft picks. Soon after, in August 2023, he signed a substantial four-year, $68.5 million contract extension with the Vikings.</p><p>Throughout his NFL career, Hockenson has made a significant impact with his impressive stats, accumulating a total of 246 receptions for 2,587 yards and 18 touchdowns in 57 games played.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>T.
